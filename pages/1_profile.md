I graduate with a Ph.D. from Shanghai Jiao Tong University (985, QS Ranking 51) and completed my Master's and Bachelor's degrees at Dalian University of Technology (985, QS Ranking 491). My research team was led by Professor Zhang Wenjun (a recipient of the National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars) and Professor Song Li from the Institute of Image Communication and Network Engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.
My research interests include AIGC, 3D Vision, 3D Gaussian Splatting, NeRF, Point Cloud, FVV, DIBR, etc. To date, I have published 16 papers in top international and domestic conferences and journals such as AAAI and IEEE TMM. During my Ph.D., as a team leader, he led more than ten graduate students to participate in major scientific research projects such as the National Key Research and Development Program and the Central Universities' Science and Technology Leading Talent Team Project, with a total funding of over 50 million yuan. I have established extensive cooperation and contacts with research institutions such as Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Dalian University of Technology, the Institute of Automation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Liaoning Normal University, and companies like Intel, ZTE, Huawei, Honor, Migu, Mango, Shenzhen Ultra HD, Jiaxing Chao Wei, Yuan Guang Software, and others.
