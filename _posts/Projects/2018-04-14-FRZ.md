### My works
* Model design and parameter adjustment
* Conduct part of experiments
* Write documents

## 1. Overview
* Given a dataset which consists of financial information of much users and labeled by financial default or not, we are asked to predict a new user would be default or not. 
* The dataset is extremely unbalance. 
* We are asked to get better values of AUC and KS.

## 2. Data preprocessing
Firstly we fill in missing values with the middle value. Then we get the importance of each feature with XGBoost, and cut out the features that has little score. After that, we extend some features with one-hot encoding.

## 2. Models
We design three models for this project, LR model gets best training speed, XGboost model gets best performance, and CNN model gets best generalization ability. Our partner choose the CNN model in the end. 

### 2.1. LR model
As the number of positive samples is much more than negative samples, we divide the positive samples into 7 parts, and designed 7 LR models. Each part of positive samples combined with negative samples are used as training data of a LR model. Then the 7 LR models are united by Ensemble learning methods like bagging and boosting. 

### 2.2. XGboost model
I use XGboost to predict the classifier. The dataset is divided into 10 parts, and 10 fold cross validation is used to evaluate the parameters. After getting the best values of AUC and KS, I transform the distribution of the data into a normal distribution to meet the demand:

### 2.3. CNN model
We designed a simple CNN model based on VGG19 as well. Over sampling is used to solve the problem of extremely unbalance. The data after preprocessing is combined with results of AutorEncoder, then it is used as input of the CNN model. The KS curve and ROC curve is shown as below.
