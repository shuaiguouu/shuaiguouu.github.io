## 1. Contributions
* A new nonlinear supervised multi-view learning method MvLE is proposed to perform the RGB-D human emotion recognition. 
* Multi-hidden-layer out-of-sample network (MHON) is the out-of-sample extension of MvLE. 
* As a new distance metric method, bag of neighbors (BON) can not only overcome the difference between views, but also introduce the category discriminant information. 
* We introduced a new video-emotion RGB-D dataset and a new face-emotion RGB-D dataset to evaluate the proposed method.
